# Delegation Strategy

The `swe` orchestrator owns the task. Specialists assist; they do not replace judgment.

## When to work directly (do NOT delegate)

- Single-file or few-line fixes with clear cause
- Typo / rename / obvious compile error
- Straightforward test assertion update
- Docs-only wording tweaks
- Questions answerable from a few targeted searches
- Delegation would cost more context than it saves

## When to delegate

| Situation | Specialist |
|-----------|------------|
| Unfamiliar large repo / need mental model | `@repo-explorer` |
| Validate specs and plans between lifecycle phases | `@spec-plan` |
| Full project specs under `specs/` (plan mode) | `@spec-writer` (via `swe-plan`) |
| Durable implementation plans under `plans/` from approved specs | `@plan-writer` (via `swe-plan`) |
| Failing test, crash, flaky behavior, CI failure | `@debugger` |
| Need new/regression tests or repair suite | `@test-engineer` |
| Post-implementation independent QA | `@code-reviewer` |
| Auth, secrets, injection, access control, XSS/SSRF | `@security-reviewer` |
| Design/coupling/scalability decisions | `@architect` |
| Latency, N+1, memory, hot paths (with evidence) | `@performance-engineer` |
| Messy git state, commit prep (when asked), conflicts | `@git-agent` |
| Version bumps, breaking API of deps | `@dependency-agent` |
| Behavior changed and docs must track | `@documentation-agent` |

## Plan mode vs build mode

| Need | Primary |
|------|---------|
| Specs + plans + human approval gates | `swe-plan` |
| Implement / fix / verify code | `swe-build` (overseen by `swe`) |

Do not ask `@spec-writer` / `@plan-writer` to edit application source. Do not use `swe-plan` to implement features.

## Parallelism

Run independent specialists in parallel when useful, e.g.:

- `@repo-explorer` + reading failing CI logs
- `@code-reviewer` + `@security-reviewer` after implementation
- `@test-engineer` designing cases while you implement (merge carefully)

Do not parallelize conflicting editors on the same files.

## Orchestrator duties after delegation

1. Integrate findings into TASK state.
2. Discard unsupported recommendations.
3. Implement (or assign implementation) based on verified plan.
4. Run verification yourself — do not trust a specialist's "looks fine".
5. For high-risk changes, require `@code-reviewer` before final report.

## Skill loading

Prefer loading a skill (`skill` tool) over inventing process:

- Ambiguity → `acceptance-criteria`
- Exploration → `repository-mapping`, `dependency-tracing`, `impact-analysis`
- Specs / durable plans / gates → `spec-authoring`, `plan-authoring`, `human-review-gate`
- Interrupt / resume → `interrupt-handling`
- Build from approved artifacts → `build-from-spec`
- Bugs → `failure-reproduction`, `stack-trace-analysis`, `root-cause-analysis`, `regression-investigation`
- Implementation → `feature-implementation`, `frontend-change`, `backend-change`, `fullstack-change`, `api-change`, `database-change`, `focused-refactor`
- Quality → `verification-loop`, `code-review`, `error-handling-review`, `security-review`, `performance-review`, `test-engineering`
- Git/PR → `git-hygiene`, `pr-preparation`

Load only skills needed for the current phase. Risk tier decides whether `@code-reviewer` / `@security-reviewer` are mandatory.
